Question : What are conditional statements? Explain conditional statements with syntax and examples.

Answer : Conditional statements are allow us to make decisionan based on the some conditional statements. For example, If my age is greater than 18 year then I can vote.

There are some conditional statement which we used in JavaScript programming Language.

-> IF conditional statement

Syntax :      if(condition){
                  //Body  (execute if condtion is true)
             }

Example : if(AIR<10){
             console.log("Get IIT CSE BRANCH");
          }

-> IF Else conditional statement

Syntax :     if(condition) {
              //body (execute if condtion is true)
             } else {
                // run another code
             }

Example:     if(age>18) {
               console.log("You can vote");
            } else {
               console.log("You cannot vote");
            }

-> IF ELSE IF Conditional statement

Synatx :     if(condition1){
              //body (execute if condtion1 is true)
             } else if(condition2){
             //body  (execute if condtion2 is true)
             } else if(condition3){
              //body (execute if condtion3 is true)
             }

Example:    if(Temp<15){
              console.log("Weather is cold);
            } else If(Temp>15 && Temp<25) {
                console.log("Weather is not so cold and not so hot);
            } else if(Temp>25) {
                console.log("Weather is hot");
            }

-> Switch statements: It is used when we have certain number of choice. Switch statements are take a single expression/value as an input, and then look through several choices until they find one that matches that value, executing the correspond code that go along with it.

Synatx:   switch (expression) {
          case choice1:
          // run this code
           break;

          case choice2:
          // run this code instead
           break;

         // include as many cases as you like

         default:
         // only just run this code
         break;
         } 

Example: 

switch(choice) {
      case "sunny":
      console.log("Sport will be play Outside");
      break;

      case "rainy":
      console.log("Sport will not play Outside");
      break;

      case "cold";
      console.log("wear warm clothes then go outside");
      break; 

      default:
      console.log("");
}
