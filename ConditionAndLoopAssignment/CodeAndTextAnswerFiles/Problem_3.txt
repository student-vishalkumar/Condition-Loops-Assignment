Question : What are loops, and what do we need them? Explain different types of loops with their syntax and example

Answer: 
Loops in programming are used to repeat a block of code until the given condition is met. A loop statement allows programmers to execute a  statements multiple times without repetition of code.

Need of Loops : 
Without loop we do not print thousand of statements by writing the code but this possible due to Loops.

Types of loops :
1) for loop
2) while loop
3) do-while loop

1) For loop : 
This loop repeats until the define condition evaluates to false.

Syntax : 
for (initialization; condition; changer)
  statements

Example : 
for(let i=0; i<6; i++){
    console.log(i);
}

output: // 0,1,2,3,4,5

2) While loop : 
A while statement executes its statements as long as a defined condition evaluates to true.

Syntax :
initialisation;
while(condition){
    statement;
    postincrement
}

Example:
let i = 0;
while(i<10){
    console.log(i);
    i++;
}

3) do-while loop: 
This loopx repeats statement until a specified condition evaluates to false.

Syntax:
do
  statement
while (condition);

Example: 
let i = 0;
do {
  i =i + 1;
  console.log(i);
} while (i < 10);
